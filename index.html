        <p>I am an <strong><a href="https://dufss.ac.bd/department-of-anthropology/">Anthropology</a></strong> graduate from the <strong>University of Dhaka, Bangladesh</strong>. One of the best thing I acquired from having an Anthropology degree is
          to be more understanding towards human diversity from the native
          point of view. During my graduation years, besides completing academic courses, monograph and thesis, I was involved with different volunteer organizations that increased my flexibility to work with people and my leadership qualities.</td>
